In this assignment, we design and query a SQL database for the fictional O’donald’s Burgers fast food chain. The task involves three parts: constructing and populating the database with tables and sample data, performing business analysis using advanced SQL queries, and modifying the database schema to support cost evaluation of meals. Each query is implemented in a separate Python script with embedded SQL and proper documentation.
